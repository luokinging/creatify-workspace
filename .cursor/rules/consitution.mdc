# Constitution - Mandatory Rule Reading Protocol

**This is the constitution file. ALL tasks MUST read and follow this protocol before execution.**

## Task Type Identification

Before starting any task, identify the task type:
- **Frontend**: Tasks involving `main-web-ui/` directory
- **Backend**: Tasks involving `webserver/` directory  
- **Fullstack**: Tasks spanning both `main-web-ui/` and `webserver/`

## Mandatory Rule Reading Protocol

### Step 1: Read the Index File

Based on task type, read the corresponding index file:
- **Frontend**: `.project-rules/frontend/index.md`
- **Backend**: `.project-rules/backend/index.md`
- **Fullstack**: `.project-rules/fullstack/index.md`

### Step 2: Recursive Reading (CRITICAL)

**MANDATORY**: After reading the index file, you MUST recursively read ALL "Mandatory" or "Required" documents referenced within that index file. 

**Reading only the index is INSUFFICIENT.** You must:
1. Read the index file to identify mandatory documents
2. Read each mandatory document referenced in the index
3. Apply the rules and conventions from those documents to your task

### Step 3: Document Compliance

When completing tasks, document which index file and which mandatory documents were consulted to ensure compliance.

## Rule Collections

- **Frontend**: `.project-rules/frontend/index.md` → Architecture, MVC, Workflow, Convention, Directory Structure, Examples
- **Backend**: `.project-rules/backend/index.md` → Backend standards and conventions
- **Fullstack**: `.project-rules/fullstack/index.md` → Cross-surface coordination rules

**Failure to follow this recursive reading protocol is a violation of this constitution.**
