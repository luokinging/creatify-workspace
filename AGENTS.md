## Project Rules

This project has a dedicated `.project-rules` directory that contains detailed information about project-specific rules and conventions. As an AI agent, it is **critical** that you read and adhere to these rules.

### Entry Points

The `index.md` file within each subdirectory (`frontend`, `backend`, `fullstack`) serves as the entry point for the rules of that specific domain. You should always start by reading the `index.md` file to understand which documents are mandatory and which are optional.

### Frontend Rules (`.project-rules/frontend/`)

The most comprehensive set of rules is for the frontend. The `index.md` file in this directory outlines a set of **mandatory** documents that all AI agents must read before starting any task. These documents cover:

*   **Architecture:** The core architectural principles of the project, including the Manager pattern.
*   **MVC Architecture:** Standards for implementing ViewControllers and Managers.
*   **Development Workflow:** Standardized procedures for different types of tasks (e.g., bug fixes, feature development).
*   **Programming Conventions:** Quick-reference guide for development and a list of absolute prohibitions.
*   **Directory Structure:** The standard organization of feature directories.
*   **Examples and Patterns:** In-depth explanations of design patterns with practical examples.

The `index.md` file also provides guidance on how to discover and read optional documents based on the specific requirements of your task.

### Backend and Fullstack Rules

The `backend` and `fullstack` directories also contain `index.md` files that serve as entry points to their respective rules. While these are currently less detailed than the frontend rules, you should still consult them before working on backend or fullstack tasks.

**Your primary instruction is to always consult the relevant `index.md` file in the `.project-rules` directory before starting any new task.** This will ensure that you are following the correct procedures and conventions for the project.
